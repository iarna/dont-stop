# dont-stop

DON'T STOP is a weird little full screen terminal based game.

![](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc-images/Dont-Stop.gif?1)

Clear all the `ouch`es by firing arrows at them.  When they're clear
progress to the next level with more `ouch`es.  Sometimes, occasionally, an
`ouch` will reform after it explodes as an `adversary` who will try to shoot
you. You don't need to clear them, but clearing them gives you health.

See how far you can make it!

It's very much a WIP.

```console
$ npm install -g iarna/dont-stop
$ dont-stop
```
Or
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/iarna/dont-stop
$ cd dont-stop
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Controls

* Move with arrow keys, wasd or hjkl
* Space to shoot.
* Ctrl-C to exit

## TODO

Investigate a version that uses emoji-type chars
