# dont-stop

DON'T STOP is a weird little full screen terminal based game.

It's very much a WIP.

```console
$ npm install -g iarna/dont-stop
$ dont-stop
```
Or
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/iarna/dont-stop
$ cd dont-stop
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Controls

* Move with arrow keys, wasd or hjkl
* Space to shoot.
* Ctrl-C to exit
